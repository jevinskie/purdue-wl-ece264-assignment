Why Apple tablet may not be the gadget of the future
By David Goldman staff writerDecember AM ET


NEW YORK CNNMoneycom Gadget lovers are waiting with bated breath for the 
muchanticipated unveiling of the Apple tablet but dont expect it to take the
world by storm the way the iPod and iPhone did

There will be a strong interest in it but it wont be the wave of the future
said James Brehm analyst at Frost Sullivan

Tablet computers are hardly a new concept In fact Apple already brought a tab
let device to the market in in the form of the Newton MessagePad Despite 
a ton of hype Apple AAPL Fortune only sold a few hundred thousand Newto
ns in the five short years it was on the market

Other tabletlike devices have also fizzled The Compaq iPAQ and the Palm PALM
Pilot were quickly replaced by smart phones Consumers can find some modernd
ay tablets in the form of notebook computers with swiveling monitors but the
yre clunky expensive and havent taken off

The problem with handheld tablets is that theyre middleoftheroad devices T
hey have better functionality than smaller gadgets but dont have enough functi
onality to replace your PC

Though Apple hasnt released any details about its tablet analysts who have be
en briefed on the device say it will run apps like the iPhone and iPod Touch do
but the tablet will be better suited for watching movies and reading Accordi
ng to a New York Times report Apple will unveil a tablet on Jan 

The Apple tablet will have a beautiful user interface it will have a pleasing
aesthetic and will be marketed well said Chris Collins senior consumer rese
arch analyst at Yankee Group But at the end of the day were still talking a
bout a smart phone with a bigger screen

Collins anticipates the tablet will initially take off with lots of excitement
but ultimately he expects it will help accelerate innovation in smaller gadget
s like smartphones and bring down prices for PCs

Such was the fate of netbooks Shipments of the mini ultraportable notebook c
omputers soared in and earlier this year However sales have cooled off a
s fullsized notebook prices dropped and smart phone performance grew accordi
ng to John Jacobs NPD Groups director of notebook market research As a resul
t NPD expects netbook shipments to grow just in 

Netbooks won the battle but lost the war said Collins Eventually people e
ither went to a smartphone or a notebook Tablets will also generate a lot of i
nterest initially but they will ultimately suffer a similar fate
Too pricey

Tablet technology doesnt come cheap Creating screens that allow users to writ
e on them is a costly endeavor and swivelmonitor notebooks tend to run severa
l hundred dollars more than nontablet peers

Apple will likely need to charge around for the device analysts say whic
h could relegate the tablet to niche status That price point could be t
oo rich for some and others may opt to spend just a little more for a fullfunc
tion laptop computer
 Apple succeeds despite flops

Brehm and Collins argued that the there will be some compelling uses for the ta
blet including notetaking for students or examining electronic health records
for physicians Apple fans will also bite because well its an Apple product
and its bound to be really cool

The market will be there but this will definitely be more of a niche product
said Brehm who was Gateways tablet product manager a decade ago
Apple may pull it off

The tablet will have to offer more than the iPhone or iPod Touch to be successf
ul say analysts

They have to trump themselves said Laura DiDio principal analyst at ITIC 
That will be difficult but the tablet shouldnt only be an iPhone with a bigge
r screen Its going to have to bring something new to the table to be successf
ul

DiDio said the tablet will have a inch to inch screen and a highend grap
hics card that will enable stunning resolution even more so than the iPhone 
and iPod Touch She said the device will come in several different models that 
offer varieties of Internet connections such as WiFi or G perhaps through a
contract with ATT T Fortune A Web cam will also be available for vide
o conferencing

Is that enough to change the gadget game Maybe Analysts counted out Apple bef
ore the iPod changed the music player and before the iPhone reimagined the sma
rtphone

Likewise it may be too soon to count out the longawaited tablet Even tablet 
detractors know better than to dismiss a Steve Jobs creation too quickly

There have been tablets before and they did not take off said Brehm There
had been MP players before too but we hadnt seen anything like the iPo
d before To top of page
