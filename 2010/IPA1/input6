Watch for blue moon on New Year Eve

Say you only celebrate New Years Eve once in a blue moon

Well get ready to kick up your heels

A blue moon will occur Dec at least by the new definition of a
blue moon

Quantcast Art Klinger director of the Penn Harris Madison
Planetarium said the new definition of a blue moon is two full moons
in a month Thats the definition most people use he noted

There was a full moon Dec and there will be another one Thursday 
New Years Eve

Since theres a full moon every days having two of them a month
is relatively rare And of course there will never be one in
February  its too short

The next blue moon under the modern definition will be in August

But if youre old fashioned at least in your moon terminology this
will not be a blue moon Theres another older definition of a blue
moon: four full moons in a quarter

According to the blue moon entry in Wikipedia the division of the
year into quarters starts with the vernal equinox on or around March

Under that definition we changed quarters Dec So this wouldnt
be a blue moon

The next blue moon under the old definition will be Nov

If a blue moon is rare the odds of it being on Dec is even
rarer Since a quarter ends Dec there will never be a New Years
Eve blue moon under the old definition

So that at least gets us down to blue moons which are two full moons
in a month

Rick Mecklenberg meteorologist for WSBT TV got on the computer and
helped out with that one The last blue moon on Dec was in
The next one will be in 

Sounds like this one would be a good excuse for an expensive bottle of
bubbly But Klinger says thats all it means calling superstitions
about the full moon nonsense

He said the moon is actually the same all the time It just depends on
how its aligned with the earth whether its full or not

According to Wikipedia the term blue moon may come from belewe
which in old English means betrayer

The church determined when Easter would occur using the full moon If
there was an extra full moon it was a betrayer moon

A blue colored moon is an entirely different animal A moon looks blue
because of dust or debris in the atmosphere such as debris from a
volcano

So if the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines blows quickly that New
Years Eve moon could possibly look blue
