d make its debut next week

Google has scheduled a press event for Tuesday January at its Mountain View
California headquarters Though the company hasnt mentioned Nexus One the
invitation mentions Android Googles mobile operating system for phones an
d the company is widely expected to show the device that has had smartphone ind
ustry watchers buzzing for weeks

The invitationonly event will be held two days before the Consumer Electronics
Show begins in Las Vegas and just one day before many CES exhibitors have sche
duled major press conferences

Its a move straight out of the Apple playbook In January Apple famou
sly upstaged CES when it unveiled the first iPhone at an event in San Francisco
even as most technology journalists and executives were huddled in Las Veg
as for the trade show

Google hasnt commented about Nexus One But recent online leaks suggest the 
Nexus One will be a GSMdevice with a inch AMOLED touchscreen megapixel 
camera WiFi connectivity accelerometer and compass It is expected to run th
e latest version of the Android operating system Android 

Where Google could really innovate is how the phone is sold The Nexus One is l
ikely to be sold unlocked which means consumers dont have to be tied into l
ongterm contracts with telecom carriers TMobile which offered the first Goo
gle phone could provide billing coverage features and rate plans says
TMONews a blog that tracks TMobile The Nexus One could also go on sale the 
morning of Jan says the site though theres no word yet on possible pric
ing

Will Google offer expensive unlocked handsets in the United States a la Nok
ia or can it come up with a clever model to subsidize the device cost throu
gh mobile advertising or carrier support Googles press conference next week
should answer that question
