If do not know where to start, fill in the codes in
the following order:
1. linklist.c/.h
2. stack.c/.h
3. maze.c/.h
4. solver.c/.h
5. main.c (already completed)

You can search for "TODO" in the source files to
find the places to fill your codes.  Of course you
are not required to follow to skeleten completely.
You may add, remove or change any files, functions,
variables, typedefs, etc., as you want.  It is also
fine to start from scratch.

In some situations the Makefile needs to be modified
accordingly.  Please be aware.
