Traditionally the most common target for malware is Microsoft Microsoft holds
a dominant stake of the operating system office productivity and Web browser
markets so its only logical that malware developers would want to fish in th
e pool with the most targets

However Mac OS X is creeping up in operating system market share and Firefox a
nd Chrome are nibbling away at the Web browser market share making them more a
ttractive targets for attack as well Adobe with Flash and Acrobat Reader is 
virtually ubiquitous across all operating system platforms and Web browsers wh
ich makes it a onestopshopping target

The McAfee report says Cybercriminals have long picked on Microsoft products d
ue to their popularity In we anticipate Adobe software especially Acrob
at Reader and Flash will take the top spot

I spoke with McAfee chief technology officer George Kurtz who explained that 
Adobe has added so much functionality to their software they are suffering the 
same fate as Microsoft with Internet Explorer

Stuart McClure vice president of operations and strategy of McAfees Risk and 
Compliance business unit agrees Adobe Apple all of the major vendors are b
eing targeted due to their proliferation and ubiquity Weve been saying it for
a long time now Microsoft has held the jeweled crown for juicy targets but th
ey wont be leading forever The day has come

Microsoft critics often imply that the Windows operating systems and Microso
ft applications like the Microsoft Office suite and Internet Explorer Web brows
er are just inherently less secure That assumption can lead users of alternat
e operating systems and Web browsers to a false sense of security that will com
e back to haunt them as malware developers expand the scope of their attacks

Adobe has already seen a rise in attacks throughout Just recently Adobe 
Reader was hit by a zeroday exploit which could allow attackers to install add
itional malicious software elements or capture sensitive information from vulne
rable systems In July of this year a flaw in Adobe Flash was targeted by attac
kers and in October attackers targeted flaws in Adobe Reader to send malicious
PDFs

Adobe wont be the only target though Attackers will continue to use shortene
d URLs to dupe users into visiting malicious Web sites or as part of phishing
attacks Like Adobe products Webbased servicesespecially social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitterspan operating systems and hardware platforms
and make very attractive targets as well

Kurtz sums it up Exploiting Adobe has become the preferred choice of attackers
simply because not many people keep their Adobe software patched It simply is
the path of least resistance
