This program validates a packing solution.

Usage:
ipa4check <dimension_file> <solution_file>

<dimension_file> is a file containing the sizes of rectangles.
<solution_file> contains positions and rotations of rectangles.


To make the executable:
Type `make' in the terminal when in the source directory.
If `make' fails because of an incompatible library, please
substitute the file "libllist.a" with "libllist.a.alt", both
contained in this package.
