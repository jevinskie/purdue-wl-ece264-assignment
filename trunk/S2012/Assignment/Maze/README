This assignment asks you to write a program finding a path to the exit of
a maze.  The assignment is dived into three stages:

1. Read maze files (due 01/23)

2. Traverse simple mazes without any intersection (due 01/30)

3. Traverse mazes with intersections (due 02/06)

* Inputs and Outputs *
**********************

Throughout the whole semester, every assignment shares the same structure:

* All assignments are graded by computer programs.  Therefore, your programs
  must follow some rules so that the grading programs can give you the
  correct results.

* Inputs are always given in files.  The names of the files are specified 
  in argv.  Nobody will sit in front of a computer entering anything.  Thus,
  your programs must not expect any input from keyboard.  Your programs should
  not have scanf (or similar function calls) that wait for inputs from keyboard.
  
* Outputs are always printed on screen.  You must use the code given to you
  for generating the outputs.  You should not change the format at all.  If the
  formats are different, you may not receive the correct points.
  
We try hard to make the grading programs correctly.  However, we make mistakes, too.
If you believe that the grading programs produce incorrect results, please inform us
as soon as possible.  Thank you for the help.
