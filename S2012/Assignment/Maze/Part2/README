In this part, your program needs to read two files.  The names
are given as argv[1] and argv[2].  The first file is the maze
and the second file is the path.

The path file contains four commands:
E- east (i.e. right)
W- west
N- north (i.e. up)
S- south 
If the input file includes any character other than these
four characters, your program should ignore the character.

Your program decides whether the path is valid.  If a path
makes the player run into a brick, the path is invalid.

A valid path does not necessarily reach the exit. More likely, a valid
path leads the player to somewhere still inside the maze.

If the path reaches the exit, it is always valid.  Your program
should ignore everything after reaching the exit.
