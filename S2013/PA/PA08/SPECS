In this assignment, you need to write README and submit it with student.c

This assignment has the following purposes:

* learn how to allocate memory when the program runs.

* You do not know the amount of memory needed in advance.  The program
reads data from a file and allocates memory as more data is read.

* The data is stored in linked lists.  This assignment asks you to
write functions that will create two types of linked lists: sorted by
by the students' IDs and sorted by the students' names.

* Your program cannot use for, while, goto, or anything similar.  If
you need to traverse the data, you must use recursion.

This assignment asks you to write a program that uses a structure called
Student.  Each Student object has two attributes: 

ID is an integer
name is a string (char *)


Your program needs to have the following functions:

* Read students' data from a file.  You do not know the length of the
  file and you must not scan the file to count the number of students.
  Instead, the program must allocate memory as more students' data is
  read.

* Write the sorted student data into files.

* When your program reads a student's name from a file, you can assume
  the name does not exceed the constant defined as MAXIMUM_LENGTH.  It
  is defined in student.c and the value is 80.  Please notice that
  this is the only place when you can assume the maximum length of
  students' names.  When your program allocates memory for individual
  students, the program must allocate only necessary amounts of
  memory.  You will lose points if your program allocates too much
  memory. If you assume that every student's name need MAXIMUM_LENGTH,
  you will lose most points.

  You may use MAXIMUM_LENGTH in at most one place in your program.

* Each of the test inputs should have distinct IDs and distinct names.
  If you find duplicates in a file, the teaching staff have made a
  mistake.  Please inform the instructor.

*************

  When your program allocates memory, you must allocate enough memory
  to store the data but not more than necessary.  In other words, you
  CANNOT use MAXIMUM_LENGTH for the length of every student's name.
  If a student's name needs only 11 characters (including '\0'), your
  program should allocate memory for only 11 characters.

  If your program allocates more memory than necessary, you will lose
  1% for every unnecessary byte.

  You will receive zero if your program allocate a large amount of
  memory that is independent of the size of the input file.  For
  example, if you do this

  #define LARGESIZE 10000
  Student stu[LARGESIZE]; 
  /* allocate a large array, 
     regardless of the size of the input file */

  The teaching staff will manually inspect your program to ensure that
  you do not violate this rule.  You will receive zero even if your
  program passes the computer grader.

  You are allowed to have at most one array whose size is
  MAXIMUM_LENGTH inside each function as a local variable. 

  You should never have any global variable or static variable.  You
  will lose one point (i.e. 25% of the full score) for each global or
  static variable.

  You are allowed to use static functions.

The purpose of this assignment is to help you understand linked list.
Thus, for this assignment, you cannot use fseek or rewind.  You will
receive zero if your program uses fseek or rewind. You cannot use
fopen, count the length, fclose, allocate memory, and the fopen
again. (This is an indirect way of calling fseek.)

In this assignment, you will likely need to write some functions to
help the required functions.

You can use ddd to print the nodes of a linked list.

Since this assignment overlaps with PA06, you can earn some points
back for PA06.  Your score for PA06 is the higher value between
   1. original score for PA06
   2. 60% of PA08
For example, if you received 0.5 in PA06 and 4 in PA08, your score 
for PA06 becomes 2.4.

NOTE:
Type "make" to compile the source code.
Type "make grade -s" to run the grading script.
Type "make clean" to remove generated files.
