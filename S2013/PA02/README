This assignment asks you to compute several properties of an array of
integers.  The functions are the same as those in PA01 but you must
implement these functions using recursion.  You cannot use for or
while or goto.

Please copy the files from PA01, rename answer01.c to answer02.c,
and modify the functions in answer02.c.
